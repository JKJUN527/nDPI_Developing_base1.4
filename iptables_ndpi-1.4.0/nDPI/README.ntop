This directory contains a modified version of OpenDPI which
includes ntop extensions. I have tried to push them into the
OpenDPI source tree but nobody in answering emails so I have
decided to create my own source tree

==========

In case you want to add new protocols

# autoreconf -ivf
# ./configure
# make
